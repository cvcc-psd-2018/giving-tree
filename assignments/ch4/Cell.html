      <p>
        Writing this program will require a functional knowledge of processing inputs and <a href="/giving-tree/glossary#entrySelectionStructures" title="Glossary Entry">selection structures</a>.
        <br /><br />
        The premise is fairly simple -- get input from the user and process it. The only real challenge there is determining whether the user is on a Regular plan or a Premium plan. You can make the user enter the "service code" to determine that. Consider using the service code in the condition for an if/else block and dividing the Regular and Premium service calculations between them.
        <br /><br />
        Now, the next issue is actually calculating the cost. This shouldn't be too difficult -- take the base cost for the plan, and subtract the number of free minutes from how many they used and multiply the difference by the price per minute. There's just one issue -- the user isn't guaranteed to have used that many minutes. So, when should you not subtract the full number of free minutes, and what will the value <em>always</em> be if the user hasn't used any minutes beyond the free minutes? Consider using an if/else structure (or even the <a href="/giving-tree/glossary#entryTernaryOperator" title="Glossary Entry">ternary operator</a> if you're familiar with it) to sort those calculations out.
        <br /><br />
        Once you've done all that, all you need to do is format the output, which should be plenty simple. Good luck!
