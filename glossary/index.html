        Glossary
      </h1>
      <p>
        This is a collection of commonly-used terms in programming. If you're reading a resource, such as a tutorial on this site, and a word makes you go, "huh?", try looking for it here.
        <br />
        <br />
        <span class="note">Tip: Use Ctrl+F to search for a term. They're broken up into chapters, so you can also search for a chapter.</span>
        <br />
        <span class="note">Don't see a term you want defined? Create a new issue <a href="https://github.com/cvcc-psd-2018/giving-tree/issues/new">here</a> with the tag "glossary term".</span>

      <h2 id="JavaChapter1">Java Chapter 1</h2>
      <p>This chapter mostly covered basic computing terms not exclusive to programming. If you're into gaming, there's a good chance you've already heard most of these.</p>
      <h3 class="glossary-entry" id="entryInput">Input</h3>
        <p>An input is a source of data that's fed into a program. It can also be used in a more general sense to refer to the data itself.</p>
      <h3 class="glossary-entry" id="entryOutput">Output</h3>
        <p>Output is data that a program publishes, whether directly to a user or to another program or component for further processing. It can also be used to describe a component that's specifically made to handle that data.</p>
      <h3 class="glossary-entry" id="entryCPU">Central Processing Unit (CPU)</h3>
        <p>The CPU is the part of a computer that runs active calculations for most computing tasks. It can also be used to describe the CPU's processing power.</p>
      <h3 class="glossary-entry" id="entryRAM">Random Access Memory (RAM, Primary Memory)</h3>
        <p>The RAM is the part of a computer that holds data that's fed directly to and from the CPU. Most programs, along with all their variables, are kept in RAM while they're running.</p>
      <h3 class="glossary-entry" id="entryArchive">Archive (Secondary Storage)</h3>
        <p>Archive memory is where most files are kept, as well as other essentials like the operating system. It uses very little to no electricity to keep things stored in archive, so this is where we put things that we want to be able to keep when the computer is turned off. Your HDD (hard disk drive, or hard drive), SSD (solid-state drive), SD cards, USB drives, floppy disks, CDs, casettes, and so on are all things used to store archive memory.</p>
      <h3 class="glossary-entry" id="entryAlgorithm">Algorithm</h3>
        <p>An algorithm is a generalized mathematical formula that can be applied to solve a specific problem. Technically speaking, running a program is one massive algorithm, but we typically mean it in a more focused way. They can be incredibly simple (such as "the product of a number and two is the sum of the number plus itself" [or x times 2 = x + x]), or so impossibly complex that no human is physically capable of totally understanding the underlying mathematics (such as the YouTube recommendation system, and most other forms of artificial intelligence).</p>
      <h3 class="glossary-entry" id="entryCompiler">Compiler</h3>
        <p>A compiler transforms code written in a programming language (such as C) into a form that can be directly understood by the CPU. It is itself a program.</p><br />
