        Welcome to The Giving Tree!

      <p>
        This is designed to be a resource to help everyone in our class &mdash; not as a place to copy-paste from, but as a place to learn. Here you can find a plethora of tools that you can use to become the best programmer you can be; all you need is a willingness to learn and a little effort.
        <br /><br />
        If you're looking for help with specific assignments, check the <a href="/giving-tree/assignments/">Assignments</a> page and begin reading there. Copy-pasters look elsewhere -- it'll explain how to solve a problem, and include small code snippets, but in an effort to increase understanding, it will <em>not</em> include a complete program that can be effortlessly cut-and-pasted all at once.
        <br /><br />
        Need to know about specific terms? Check out the <a href="/giving-tree/glossary/">Glossary</a>, which should explain some more general terms that we use as programmers. For language-specific terms and syntax, check out the documentation for that language; any language we use in class has its docs handily linked in the <a href="/giving-tree/resources/">Resources</a>, which is also full of tons of useful tools for <em>any</em> programmer &mdash; from collaboration software to IDEs to themes to self-learning resources and a whole lot more.
        <br /><br />
        Want to see the code, or even help make improvements? Visit the <a href="https://github.com/cvcc-psd-2018/giving-tree.git">GitHub repository</a>, where you can see what makes this tick, notify us of a bug, or even suggest improvements!
        <br /><br />
        Finally, a quick reference system has been implemented. Simply click the "Add Page" button in the sidebar to add a page you're currently viewing to your navbar. If you're wondering why the hell my site is using cookies, that's why.
        <br /><br />
        All that said, you know what to do now! I'd recommend bookmarking this site in your browser by hitting Ctrl+D so you can easily refer back to it at any later date. Happy hacking!
